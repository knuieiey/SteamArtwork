# SteamArtwork
Lots of things to make making artworks easier and faster.

Just simply drag the scripts to your <programs>/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop/Presets/Scripts folder
After, you can open Your template (616px wide), make Your artwork and easily export it without any effort with cropping etc...
You can also create a new artwork project using my script.
  
To execute scripts in photoshop, File->Scripts->(choose the script You want to execute)
